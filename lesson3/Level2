We need to decrease issues count and priority in Python for QA - bugs list - Sheet1.csv. Write a program to decrease each issue priority to one level (critical -> high, high -> medium, medium -> low), issues that have low level now should be removed. Save result into new CSV file.

Write a script to automatically generate directories and files (empty 6 files with names task*.py where * is task number between 1 and 6) structure for python-for-qa course. Result should look the following way:

python-for-qa
lesson1
task1.py
...
task6.py
lesson2
