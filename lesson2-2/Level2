'''
Write program to evaluate (a or not b) and (c or not a) expression for boolean varibles a, b, c showing result for all possible variables combinations.

Write a function to return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. Since the number 13 is very unlucky, it does not count, and numbers that come immediately after a 13 also do not count. Array could contain strings and boolean values (do not count them too):

sum13([1, 2, 2, 1]) -> 6
sum13([1, 1]) -> 2
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13]) -> 6
sum13([1, 2, 2, 1, 13, 5, 4, 2]) -> 6
Write a function that returns dictionary where keys are even numbers between 1 and n and values are keys in square, by default n = 100.
